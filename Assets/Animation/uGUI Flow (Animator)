uGUI Flow (Animator)


TODO: 
	Back (set trigger when not going back or reset bool when going back)
	Test UI overlap
	Make StartTrigger more robust (no prefabbing)

What?

Visual Programmable FSM for uGUI Panels

[image]

Why?
JS,MG,Futurama event driven Menu State Machine
-> + visual Unity love


Right now View -> sends Events to FSM
Scene (IView/BaseView -> cancas -> panel)
	Alternatives
 		Prefab?
 		Scene (Panel)


 StateMachine -> 

Animator / AnimationController
State - Transition - State 
BaseState.View.sendEvent -> StateMachine.Animator.setTrigger -> switch state






What it is not!
- a animator based state machine
- only UI/Panel / Scene / prefab
